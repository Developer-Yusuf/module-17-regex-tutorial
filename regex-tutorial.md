<h1>Tutorial: Matching an Email Using Regular Expressions</h1>
A regular expression, also known as regex, is a sequence of characters utilized for pattern matching in text. These expressions are highly valuable for extracting data with specific patterns, such as phone numbers or email addresses, from text. They can be implemented in various programming languages, including JavaScript.

## Overview
In this tutorial, we will analyze the essential components of the following regex, which is designed to match an email address:``` /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/```. Understanding this regex will be beneficial for validating email inputs in different applications.

### Anchors
This regex utilizes the anchors ```^``` (denoting the start of the string) and ```$``` (denoting the end of the string). Since multiline mode is not enabled, these markers indicate the start and end of the string, rather than the start and end of a line.

### Quantifiers
The regex employs the quantifiers ```+``` (indicating one or more occurrences) and ```{x, y}``` (specifying a range from``` x to y```). For instance, the first```` + ```denotes one or more characters that meet the requirements of``` [a-z0-9_\.-]```, while the subsequent``` +``` signifies one or more characters within the group``` [\da-z\.-]```. Moreover,``` {2, 6} ```indicates a range of two to six characters within the group ```[a-z\.]```.

### OR Operator
The``` []``` OR operator is used in this regex. For example, ```[a-z0-9_\.-] ```matches any character from a to z (case-insensitive), any digit from``` 0 to 9```, ```_```, ```.```, or ```-```. The ```\``` is utilized to indicate a literal ```.```, rather than its usual meaning of "any character".

### Character Classes
This regex employs the character class ````\d```, which represents any digit from ``` 0 to 9```. The``` \ ```is used to specify the character class, differentiating it from the plain letter ```d```, which would represent the literal letter ```d```.

### Flags
The regex is enclosed within two ```/``` characters, without any flags. Since multiline mode is not enabled (as indicated by the absence of an```` m``` flag at the end), the anchors match the string's start and end, rather than the start and end of each line.

### Grouping and Capturing
The regex uses () parentheses for grouping and capturing. The first set of parentheses captures the username of the email address, the second set captures the domain name, and the final set captures the domain. Specifically, ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ ```means one or more characters from ``` a to z ```(case-insensitive), ```0 to 9```,``` _```,``` .```, or ```-```, followed by a literal ```@```, followed by one or more characters from any digit 0 to 9, a to z (case-insensitive),``` .```, or``` -```, followed by a literal ., and ending with 2 to 6 characters from a to z (case-insensitive) or ```.```.
